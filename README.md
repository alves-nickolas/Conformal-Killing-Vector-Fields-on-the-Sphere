[Asymptote](https://asymptote.sourceforge.io/) code for drawing conformal Killing vector fields on top of a sphere. The code plots the vectors by choosing points in spherical coordinates, but the vector field itself is inserted in (real) stereographic coordinates. Other vector fields can be plotted as well. This is an Asymptote approach to the figures on Sec. 4.5 of arXiv: [2504.12521 [gr-qc]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12521).
